## Project/Repo Title: Hi-Ho Job Search (Frontend)

Description: A job search application website using USAJobs and Numbeo API. A user is able to search for any job in a city, click on the job title and view all the cost of living information. Numbeo will provide gas, utilities, rent, etc prices along with a Cost of Living Index using New York as a baseline of 100.

How to use: On the home page, without needing to register, a user can search for Jobs by typing in the type of job, location, and search radius. Once a user is registered the user can save the jobs into their profile page for future reference. Cost of living information will be made available on the profile page as well.
